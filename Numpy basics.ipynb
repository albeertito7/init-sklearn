    "# Numpy basics\n",
    "Numpy is a library that provides an easy interface to work with N-dimensional arrays, instead of using the pure python alternative that is nested lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more. And also, supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries \n",
    "\n",
    "Open source software, distributed under a liberal BSD license, NumPy is developed and maintained publicly on GitHub by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse community.\n",
    "- **Author:** Travis Oliphant\n",
    "- **Creation year**: 2005\n",
    "- **Last stable version:** 1.19.2\n",
    "- **Programme type:** Numerical analysis software\n",
    "- **Programmed in:** Python; C; Fortran\n",
    "- **Programming languages:** Python, C\n",
    "- **Code base:** https://github.com/numpy/numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main problem we can have using numpy is that we cannot use values that are not numeric** (see: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.types.html for all the available types). \n",
    "*Although this is not entirely true, as we will see when using pandas, this library is focused on working with numbers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy aims to provide an array object that is **up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The array object in NumPy is called **ndarray**, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data Science:** is a branch of computer science where is studied how to store, use and analyze data for deriving information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is NumPy faster than Python lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main reason why **NumPy is faster than lists**. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**To install python is used 'pip' as package manager but there are others like 'anaconda' that can be used as well**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check if the numpy python module is installed, just running the next command in our shell. If so, it will show us information about it along with the version."
