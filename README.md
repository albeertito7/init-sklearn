# init-sklearn

Repository with the aim of getting started with specific technologies for data science and machine learning. 

## Notebooks

Files based on jupyter notebooks where the learning of each of the technologies is deepened:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): library that provides support for creating large multidimensional vectors and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on them.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): software library written as an extension to NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it provides data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): machine learning library that includes various classification, regression and cluster analysis algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, Gradient boosting, K-means and DBSCAN. Toolkit including Numpy and Pandas.


## Get started

> **Note**: You must have a version of python higher than 3.3

Install "jupyter" running `pip install jupyter` or `conda install -c conda-forge notebook` depending on what package manager do you prefer

## Open the notebooks

Just run `jupyter notebook {filename.ipynb}`
